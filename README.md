A Chromium extension which automatically redirects "wikipedia.org" URLs/URIs to "0wikipedia.org"

I've developed this extension for the people in whose countries Wikipedia is blocked. In fact, I wouldn't need such an extension if Wikipedia wasn't blocked in my country. (_Turkey_ 🇹🇷)

<br>
<br>
## Usage

It's enough to have installed **GoZero**. It automatically redirects to you Wiki Zero.

> Tested with Chrome 62.0.3202.94 Official x64 and Opera 49
