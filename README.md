# GoZero

###### __*[Türkçe](https://berkantkz.github.io/GoZero/tr)*__

A Chromium extension which automatically redirects "wikipedia.org" URLs/URIs to "0wikipedia.org"

I've developed this extension for the people in whose countries Wikipedia is blocked. In fact, I wouldn't need such an extension if Wikipedia wasn't blocked in my country. (Turkey 🇹🇷)


## Usage

>It's enough to have installed this extension. It automatically redirects to you Wiki Zero.
